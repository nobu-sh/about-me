          <h1>A Little Bit About Myself</h1>
          <h5 class="info"><span class="type">BLOG</span> â€“ <span class="date">August 22nd, 2022</span></h5>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Heyo,</p>
          <p>My name is <span class="note">Nobu</span>, and I'm a software developer located in East Moline, Illinois specializing in creating and designing high-quality websites and applications. I also ponder around with many other hobbies though like gamedev, 3d modeling, and pixel art.</p>
          <br>
          <h2>Where It All Started</h2>
          <p>Way back around the age of 10, I enjoyed playing <a href="https://www.minecraft.net" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>. <span class="note">If you are unfamiliar with Minecraft, it's a multiplayer voxel sandbox game where you can do just about whatever you want.</span></p>
          <p>After playing the game for a while, I stumbled across a feature they have implemented called command blocks; command blocks introduced a high-level type of logic/arithmetic for controlling particular in-game functionality.</p>
          <div class="contentImage">
            <div class="imgContainer">
              <img src="./public/commandblock.webp" alt="nil">
            </div>
            <p>Command Block In Minecraft</p>
          </div>
          <p>After self-teaching these features, I stumbled across a few development teams related to the usage of commands and worked with them for a few years.</p>
          <div class="contentImage">
            <div class="imgContainer">
              <img src="./public/team.webp" alt="nil">
            </div>
            <p>Team Photo</p>
          </div>
          <h2>More Advancement</h2>
          <p>Moving forward, around the age of 13, I was sitting in class one day bored templating things to do other than school, unsurprisingly enough, I stumbled across <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy's</a> course for <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript" target="_blank">learning JavaScript</a>.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Eventually, I felt confident enough to try to make my first <a href="https://www.javascript.com/" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> project with <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank" >Node.js</a>, so I went and installed <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VSCode</a>, then sat... <span class="note">I had no clue what to make ðŸ¤”</span></p>
          <br>
          <h2>My First Project!</h2>
          <p>After a lot of pondering, I decided to make a <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> bot. One of my friends at the time was an artist, so she drew me a mascot for the bot, and we decided to name it Nyaa. Throughout making this bot, I learned many things about JavaScript and basic programming concepts. <span class="note">Sadly anything related to this bot as of today has been lost in time.</span></p>
          <br>
          <p>Shortly after making this bot, I sadly fell out with the artist friend. However, looking back, I don't regret this, as it led me to meet two of my now good friends, <a href="https://github.com/AndresSweeneyRios" target="_blank">Andres</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JSH32">Josh</a>.</p>
          <br>
          <h2>New Friends</h2>
          <p>If there is one thing I've taken so far from life, it's that friends will come and go. Throughout this wild process, you will find long-term friends you cherish the most. I consider Andres and Josh to be in that long-term category. Josh helped me dive into more complex CIS concepts, which helped my problem-solving skills and understanding of how these languages interact with software and hardware. Andres helped me prepare for my next big project by teaching me front-end technologies and helping me form a fundamental design sense.</p>
          <br>
          <h2>The Big Project</h2>
          <p>When I first started learning how to code, I was inspired by a guy <span class="note">whose identity I will keep private for security reasons</span>. They made and managed a free-to-watch anime streaming platform. Sadly, the website and app were discontinued due to personal reasons from the owner. Ever since that day, I have wanted to create an anime streaming platform of my own. After a few days of consideration, I named it Animiru and started making a basic front-end and back-end</p>
          <p><span class="note">Sadly once again most proof of existence for this platform was lost.</span></p>
          <div class="contentImage">
            <div class="imgContainer">
              <img src="./public/animiru.webp" alt="nil">
            </div>
            <p>Animiru's v2 Player</p>
          </div>
          <p>After maintaining Animiru for about 2 years I was approached by two somewhat shady guys who offered to buy it off me for a decent sum of money. After some consideration, I ended up accepting the offer which ended my ownership and development of Animiru.</p>
          <br>
          <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
          <p>After selling off Animiru, I officially was a wild programmer let loose in his world of 1s and 0s. I started reaching broader in my ideas for projects. I started learning fundamental game development at one point in time in Unity.</p>
          <div class="contentImage">
            <div class="imgContainer">
              <img src="./public/unity_test.webp" alt="nil">
            </div>
            <p>First Unity Test Project</p>
          </div>
          <p>I also dabbled around in Unreal Engine and Godot but never really produced anything worth mentioning.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Around this time, though, I started getting back into the Minecraft development scene. But rather than primitive commands, using DLL injection to hook the server binary's native methods, properties, etc. To provide a native API for modding.</p>
          <div class="contentImage">
            <div class="imgContainer">
              <img src="./public/claim.webp" alt="nil">
            </div>
            <p>Bedrock Modding Support</p>
          </div>
          <p>This led me to work with a friend to create multiple open-source tools for the Minecraft Bedrock community.</p>
          <div class="contentImage">
            <div class="imgContainer">
              <img src="./public/beapi.webp" alt="nil">
            </div>
            <p>BeAPI</p>
          </div>
          <p><a href="https://mcbe-utilities.github.io/BeAPI/" target="_blank">BeAPI</a> an open source scripting API tool we made</p>
          <div class="contentImage">
            <div class="imgContainer">
              <img src="./public/berp.webp" alt="nil">
            </div>
            <p>BeRP</p>
          </div>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/nobu-sh/BeRP" target="_blank">BeRP</a> a networking client for Bedrock edition UDP networking. there were also many closed source unfinished tools we have, but these are the primary ones.</p>
          <br />
          <h2>Recognition</h2>
          <p>Because of the communities I associated with and the way I networked myself. When these tools were released and got recognition, it caused me to get a lot of job opportunities in the freelance scene. As of today, that is where I reside; I hop from company to company working on their projects. I also have a lot of personal projects currently in the works with no definite release dates.</p>
          <br>
          <h2>Happy Ever After?</h2>
          <p>As of right now, I would answer that inquiry with a yes. Lots of other projects and events occurred on that timeline, but I glossed over most of it. <span class="note">Maybe i'll make a blog website where everyone can have a little peek into my crazy schizophrenic brain... ðŸ‘€</span></p>
          <br>
          <p>See you space cowboy...</p>
